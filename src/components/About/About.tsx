					Over the past few years, I’ve immersed myself in software development

					balance between front-end creativity and back-end problem-solving.

					These days, I’m expanding my skills in technologies like C# and
					the .NET Framework, always excited to tackle new challenges. I thrive on
					collaborating in team settings where I can both learn from others and
					contribute to solutions. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me{" "}
